# Custom React & ReactDOM Implementation

A simple custom implementation of `React` and `ReactDOM` that enables creating and rendering JSX elements in the browser. This project includes basic support for attributes, styles, nested children, and event listeners, mimicking the core behavior of React components.


## Features

- **JSX-like Elements**: Create UI components using `createElement`, similar to React.
- **Attributes & Styles**: Supports HTML attributes and inline styles.
- **Nested Children**: Allows nested children, including text nodes and other elements.
- **Event Listeners**: Basic event handling for elements (e.g., `onClick`).
- **Support for Functional Components**: Detects functional components and renders them.
